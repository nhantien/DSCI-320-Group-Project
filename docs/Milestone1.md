# Milestone I
## Proposal, Data and Task Abstraction and Initial Sketches 

## Assessment
6% of your Overall course Grade

## Goal
In this project assignment, you are required to organize yourself into groups for the final project and describe in
detail the dataset, the tasks you plan to support and the initial sketches. The proposal should be as complete and 
exhaustive as possible so that you can receive meaningful feedback from the teaching staff early. 

## Identify Project and Group
The TAs have sourced for datasets based on the suggestions students mentioned on the discussion forum
- Select a group based on the dataset. Note that we can have multiple groups working on the same dataset.
- It is advisable to choose team members who are in your same lab section (either 11 or 12:30pm) as this might help with scheduling work-in meetings. But this is NOT a requirement
- Create a project name and group name. 
- In rare occassions, you will be allowed to use a different dataset, this dataset MUST be approved by the instructor before you complete this milestone.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Using what you have learned in data, engaged in EDA, feel free to focus on the visual summaries as opposed to both numerical and visual
- Perform and submit an analysis of the data set (reference the Data Abstraction lectures)
- Perform EDA and submit the notebook: must be a python notebook that can run (make sure that you place your data online so that it is read in using a url)


## Project Scope
Based on your exploratory data analysis you will submit the following
### Introduction
A brief description of the project topic and motivation.
### Data Analysis
Using the principles you were exposed to in the Data Abstraction lecture (i.e, Lec 2), describe the dataset
This will include the semantics, the data attribute type, the cardinality for each attribute. 
### Task Analysis
To ensure diversity in task, we will use Stasko's taxonomy for low-level tasks
- At least five distinct tasks pertaining to at least four distinct attributes. (if your group size is 4 then you should have 7 distinct tasks, that pertain to at least 6 distinct attributes)
- Sufficient overall complexity that visualizing multiple attributes using multiple views is necessary.
- All tasks must be plausible and must be addressable by the dataset(s) you are using.
- Your tasks must be complex enough that the design requirements in the Overview are met.
### Preliminary Sketches
- Using the 5-step design process you were exposed to in class (e.g. Map, Sketch, Decide, Prototype, Test) submit low-fidelity sketches for each task. 
- For each task you should create a visualization, each team member should sketch a visualization, and then as a group decide which one is best. Make sure you include screenshots of all team members sketches, as well as the one selected for the task. 
- For each selected visualization write ~200 words which summarizes:
  - What tasks in your does the visualization address? Are there new ones you should add/have added?
  - How the sketch adheres to theoretical principles you have beene exposed to this term. 

## Submission
Submission will be done on Gradescope. 
Note that there are **two** submissions
- (40%) Exploratory Data Analysis - Jupyter notebook  
- (60%) Project Scope - pdf submission 


## Grading
The grading rubrics that you have been exposed to in lab, lecture and assignments serve as guidelines. 
- EDA: must include univariate visual summaries for all attributes (both categorical and quantitative), 
  multivariate visual summaries does not need to be exhaustive but must include at least 4 unique representations for bi-variate 
- Project scope: will be graded on the quality of your writing, and the instructions outlined above. We will use specs grading, so failure to include an item will result in 0 for that rubric item. (See Quiz 1, Assignment 2 and 3 for level of granularity). 
- The data abstraction portion must include an overview of what the dataset is about, each data attribute, its type, cardinality, and semantics.
