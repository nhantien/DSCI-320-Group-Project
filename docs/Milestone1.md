# Milestone I
## Proposal, Data and Task Abstraction and Initial Sketches 

## Assessment
6% of your Overall course Grade

## Goal
In this project assignment, you are required to organize yourself into groups for the final project and describe in
detail the dataset, the tasks you plan to support and the initial sketches. The proposal should be as complete and 
exhaustive as possible so that you can receive meaningful feedback from the teaching staff early. 

## Identify Project and Group
The TAs have sourced for datasets based on the suggestions students mentioned on the discussion forum
- Select a group based on the dataset. Note that we can have multiple groups working on the same dataset.
- It is advisable to choose team members who are in your same lab section (either 11 or 12:30pm) as this might help with scheduling work-in meetings. But this is NOT a requirement
- Create a project name and group name. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Using what you have learned in data, engaged in EDA, feel free to focus on the visual summaries as opposed to both numerical and visual
- Perform and submit an analysis of the data set (refernce the Data Abstraction lectures)
- Perform EDA and submit the notebook: must be a python notebook that can run (make sure that you place your data online so that it is read in using a url)

## Project Scope
Based on your exploratory data analysis you will submit the following
### Abstract
A high-level overview of the project (~80 words)
### Introduction
A brief description of the project topic and motivation.
### Task Analysis
To ensure diversity in task, we will use Stasko's taxonomy for low-level tasks
- At least five distinct tasks pertaining to at least four distinct attributes.
- Sufficient overall complexity that visualizing multiple attributes using multiple views is necessary.
- All tasks must be plausible and must be addressable by the dataset(s) you are using.
- Your tasks must be complex enough that the design requirements in the Overview are met.  

### Preliminary Sketches
- Using the 5-step design process you were exposed to in class (e.g. Map, Sketch, Decide, Prototype, Test) submit low-fidelity sketches for each task. 
- For each visualization write ~200 words which summarizes:
  - What tasks in your does the visualization address? Are there new ones you should add/have added?
  - How the sketch adheres to theoretical principles

## Submission
Submission will be done on Gradescope. 
Note that there are multiple submissions
1. (10%) Data Abstraction - pdf submission
2. (40%) Exploratory Data Analysis - Jupyter notebook 
3. (50%) Project Scope - pdf submission 


## Grading
The grading rubrics that you have been exposed to in lab, lecture and assignments serve as guidelines. 
- Data Abstraction: submission must include an overview of what the dataset is about, each data attribute, its type and semantics.
- EDA: must include univariate visual summaries for all attributes (both categorical and quantitative), 
  multivariate visual summaries does not need to be exhaustive but must include at least 4 unique representations for bi-variate 
- Project scope: will be graded on the quality of your writing, and the instructions outlined above. We will use specs grading, so failure to include an item will result in 0 for that rubric item. (See Quiz 1, Assignment 2 and 3 for level of granularity)
